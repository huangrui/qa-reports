Feature: REST API
  As an external service
  I want to upload reports via REST API
  So that they can be browsed by users

  Background:
    Given I am an user with a REST authentication token

  Scenario: Uploading test report with HTTP POST
    When the client sends file "sim.xml" via the REST API

    Then the REST result "ok" is "1"
    And I should be able to view the created report

    And I should see "8" within "td.total"

  Scenario: Adding a report with tests that do not belong to any feature vie the new API
    When the client sends reports "spec/fixtures/no_features.xml" via the new REST API to test set "Automated" and product "N900"
